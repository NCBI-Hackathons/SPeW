# SPeW: Sequencing Pipeline Wrapper

## Introduction
Taking a sequencing pipeline from individual pieces on your workstation to a seamless pipeline that can be run by any user is currently a challenge. Here, we create a proof-of-principle simple RNA-seq pipeline using separate Bash shell scripts that are linked together using NextFlow as a pipeline management tool. This is then wrapped using Docker for distribution and seamless running on other workstations without dependency issues. 

## Methods 



## Requirements TBD

## Futher Directions 
It is the overall goal to automize the process of putting each script of a pipeline into a Nextflow document.
